# Print

## Code:
```
print("Hello")  # single string print

print("Welcome", "to", "gfg")  # multiple str print seperated by space

print()  # printing new line

print("Hope you are enjoying python")  # multiple word, but single string seperated by space
```

## Output:

```
Hello
Welcome to gfg

Hope you are enjoying python
```

# End sep
 
## Code:

```
# end and sep in print

print("welcome to", end=" ")  # line will end with " ", so no new line

print("to gfg")  # end is not given,by default new line

print("25", "08", "2020", sep='-')  # print param seperated by sep = '-'

print(10, 20, 30, sep='+', end=" ")  # print param seperated by sep = '+' and end with " " space

print(40, 50)
```
## Output:

```
welcome to to gfg
25-08-2020
10+20+30 40 50
```
